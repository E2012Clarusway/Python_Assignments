Count the number of each letter in a sentence.
The department you work for undertook a project construction that makes word / text analysis. You are asked to calculate the number of letters or any chars in the sentences entered under this project.
Write a Python program that;
takes a sentence from the user,
counts the number of each letter of the sentence,
collects the letters/chars as a key and the counted numbers as a value in a dictionary.


#letters_count

my_sentence = input("Please enter a sentence: ")
nums_of_letters = {}

for i in my_sentence:
    if i in nums_of_letters:
        nums_of_letters[i] += 1
    else:
        nums_of_letters[i] = 1
        
print(str(nums_of_letters))
