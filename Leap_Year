Find out if a given year is a "leap" year.

In the Gregorian calendar, three criteria must be taken into account to identify leap years:
The year must be evenly divisible by 4;
If the year can also be evenly divided by 100, it is not a leap year; unless...
The year is also evenly divisible by 400. Then it is a leap year.
According to these rules, the years 2000 and 2400 are leap years, while 1800, 1900, 2100, 2200, 2300, and 2500 are not the leap years.
Write a Python program that prints such as "2020 is a leap year" if the given year by the user is a leap year, prints such as "2019 is not a leap year" otherwise.

#leap_year_assignment_first_example:

year = int(input("Please enter a year: "))

if leap_year % 400 == 0 :
    print(year, "is a leap year")
elif year % 100 == 0:
    print(year, "is not a leap year")
elif year % 4 == 0:
        print(year, "is a leap year")
else:
    print(year, "is not a leap year")
    
    
#leap_year_assignment_second_example:

year = int(input("Please enter a year: "))
if year % 400 == 0 or year % 4 == 0 and year % 100 != 0 :
    print(year, "is a leap year")
else:
    print(year, "is not a leap year")
